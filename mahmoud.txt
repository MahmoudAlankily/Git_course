Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
Java - As a Programming Language

The Java programming language is a high-level, object-oriented and general-purpose computer programming language.
Java is similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors.
You can use Java to write computer applications that play games, store data or do any of the thousands of other things computer software can do.
 It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
Java - As a Computing Platform

A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. Some of the most popular platforms are Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris OS, and Mac OS.
Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!
Where is Java used?

According to Sun, 3 billion devices run java. There are many devices where java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus etc.
Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com etc.
